#+TITLE: bdosorio's Advent of Code

This is a collection of my Advent of Code attempts, by year then by day.

While I attempted prior to 2024, I didn't save my solutions.

I don't chase the leader board, I simply use the season to try new languages and tools.

* 2024 Goals

** Use Emacs Lisp, try to only use built in functions
** Complete first 10 days
